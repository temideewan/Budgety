# Budgety
From the tutorials by Jonas Schmedtman on complete JavaScript course
This is part of a tutorial series on Javascript
completing this module helped me grasp a lot of concepts about javascript
they include: Variables, control flow, Objects, closures, Immediately invoked function expressions etc.
all of this were used in conjunction with the web API to build a beautiful budget app
